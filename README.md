## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our team is interested in steam games, specifically each of our members research question is related to reviews and/or price. We are asking three main questions. Firstly, how does a game's genre affect it's reception? Are player of one genre overly positive or negative when it comes to reviewing the game's they play? Secondly, how does a game's price affect the rating it is given? Are more expensive games truly worth the extra money, are they better recieved over budget games? Lastly, how have game prices risen over time and do some games influence the price of others? With these 3 questions we hope to shed light on what influences a games rating and price, maybe providing some useful conclusions to potential developers or consumers.
