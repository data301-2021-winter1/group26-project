## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our team is interested in steam games, specifically each of our members research question is related to reviews and/or price. We are asking three main questions. Firstly, how does a game's genre affect it's reception? Are player of one genre overly positive or negative when it comes to reviewing the game's they play? Secondly, how does a game's price affect the rating it is given? Are more expensive games truly worth the extra money, are they better recieved over budget games? Lastly, how have game prices risen over time and do some games influence the price of others? With these 3 questions we hope to shed light on what influences a games rating and price, maybe providing some useful conclusions to potential developers or consumers.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Kaggle provided the dataset through the user Nik Davis under the Creative Commons license. Further, Nik Davis acquired the data from publicly available information; everything available on the Steam store, to be precise. The data contains extensive information regarding almost 30,000 games on the popular video game marketplace, Steam. The information in question includes statistics such as price, game genre, release date, game platforms, publisher, developer, average playtime, positive/negative reception, and more. This data was collected around May 2019 and is stated to contain almost every game on Steam released prior to that date. The party who collected the data states that he "wanted to make... something fun and interesting", and thus is most likely purposed for fun and public interest. The data was collected using a combination or information publicly available on the Steam store and the SteamSpy API.
